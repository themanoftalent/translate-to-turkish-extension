# Privacy Policy – Translate to Turkish Chrome Extension

Effective Date: April 25, 2025

## Introduction

The **Translate to Turkish** Chrome Extension, developed by [@themanoftalent](https://github.com/themanoftalent), respects your privacy. This policy outlines how your data is handled and explains what information is (or is not) collected when you use the extension.

---

## What This Extension Does

- Adds a right-click context menu to your browser
- Sends **selected English text** to [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) in a **new tab**
- Facilitates translation from English to Turkish using Google Translate’s public interface

---

## What Data We Collect

**We do not collect or store any user data.**  
This extension does **not**:
- Access your personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Use cookies, fingerprinting, or analytics
- Store or log selected text

---

## How the Translation Works

When you highlight text and choose "Translate to Turkish":
- That text is passed directly into a **Google Translate URL**
- A new tab is opened pointing to:  
  `https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=tr&text=YOUR_TEXT&op=translate`

At no point does the extension intercept, log, or send the data anywhere else.

---

## Permissions Explanation

The extension uses the following **Chrome permissions**:
- `contextMenus`: To add the right-click translation feature
- `tabs`: To open a new Google Translate tab
- `scripting`: To access the selected text in a webpage

These permissions are used **strictly for the stated purpose** and nothing else.

---

## Third-Party Services

This extension uses **Google Translate** as the translation provider. Your selected text is sent directly to Google Translate in your own browser via a standard URL.

> Please refer to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for how they handle translated content.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy in the future. Any updates will be reflected in this document and dated accordingly.
